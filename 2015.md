## Secondary Supervisor (if applicable):

NA

## If there are any other relevant supervision details (E.G. third supervisors or alternate contact details) please let us know here:  (Optional)

NA

## Have you been awarded CUROP funding in the past? If so, briefly describe the outcomes and impact of the project:

I have been involved in multiple successful CUROP projects in the past (as main supervisor as well as secondary supervisor).
Two students in particular: Jason Young and James Campbell.

Jason is currently doing his PhD under my supervision and has multiple articles under review.
This is a direct consequence of his successful CUROP project.

James undertook a CUROP proposal with me last year which was a great success.
During this project he wrote software that is now part of a professional mathematics package (used internationally - http://www.sagemath.org/development-map.html).
He is also currently working with me on the preparation of a manuscript for submission to a peer reviewed journal.

This evidences my ability to lead CUROP projects successfully.

## Brief Summary. Please provide a brief summary (max 300 words) of the project:

The School of Mathematics has a growing interest in Game Theory, both from a theoretical and an applied point of view.
This project aims to build on the very successful CUROP project last year during which code was implemented in to the Sage project: mathematicians around the world can now freely and easily solver game theoretic problems.

Sage is actively contributed to by mathematicians all over the world and this project will give a chance to become part of a thriving community.
The student will be expected to implement a variety of further Game Theoretic algorithms that will in the near future be included in releases of Sage.
In particular algorithms that explore the degeneracy of Normal form games will be implemented.

The project will not only involve the development of software but will also introduce the student to the use of this software in a research environment.
If successful the student will be expected to apply one of the algorithms on a research project of mine.
This will hopefully lead to a publication in a reputable mathematics journal.

Another strength of this proposal is that the code developed by the student will be used by all students of the School of Mathematics who choose to study Game Theory.

The student will be supervised closely by myself with daily meetings and will be given a computer space in one of the school's lab.

The outputs of this project will not only add value to the international Game Theoretical community but will also provide a valuable set of skills to the appointed student:

- The student will learn the basics of software development by contributing to a large scale open source software.
- The student will learn a novel piece of Mathematics (game theory is only taught in the final year).

## Please give an indicative timescale for the student’s work over the length of the project: (max 150 words)

Week 1: Gain familiarity with the Sage development process (potentially contribute a minor ticket) and read Game Theoretic literature;

Week 2: Start development branch on private server and read Game Theoretic literature;

Week 3 - 4: Full understanding of state of the art algorithms for the identification of degenerate normal form games;

Week 5 - 7: Writing of further algorithms and implementation in Sage.

Week 8: Submit code for review to Sage community and write poster.


## Proposed procedure for appointing students, including selection criteria:

The student will be selected based on interview with myself.
Interview applications will be open to all students in the School of Mathematics.

The criteria for this project is that the student have a strong ability to program, a good work ethic and an ability to absorb novel concepts quickly.
