# The Cardiff Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
## CUROP 2014
## Application guidelines and template

In 2014, applications for CUROP are being fielded for the first time online via a Bristol Online Survey.
While we realise that this is a significant change to our application process, this change will help us to make the administration of the project as efficient as possible.
This template includes all of the questions in the online application form so that you can prepare your answers prior to completing the online application.

Applications must be submitted via the online form at https://surveys.cf.ac.uk/curop2014/ by 11.50pm on Thursday 27 February 2014.

Further information and guidance is available at: http://learning.cf.ac.uk/curop/

NA

## Have you been awarded CUROP funding in the past? If so, briefly describe the outcomes and impact of the project:

I have been involved in multiple successful CUROP projects in the past (as main supervisor as well as secondary supervisor).
One student in particular: Jason Young has done extremely well thanks to his CUROP work.
He has a manuscript in preparation to be submitted to a reputable journal, and is completing his MMATH research project for his with me.
More importantly, funding has been secured for him to start his PhD next term.
This is a great success story and would not have been possible without CUROP.
Furthermore this evidences my ability to lead CUROP projects successfully.

## Brief Summary. Please provide a brief summary (max 300 words) of the project:

The School of Mathematics has a growing interest in Game Theory, both from a theoretical and an applied point of view.
This project aims to build software that will be used to solve Game Theoretic problems.

In particular this work will contribute to the open source mathematics package: Sage (http://sagemath.org/).
Sage is actively contributed to by mathematicians all over the world and this project will give a chance to become part of a thriving community.
The student will be expected to implement a variety of Game Theoretic algorithms that will in the near future be included in releases of Sage: the Gale-Shapley Algorithm the Shapley value calculation and the lrs Algorithm (amongst others).

The project will not only involve the development of software but will also introduce the student to the use of this software in a research environment.
If successful the student will be expected to apply one of the algorithms on a research project of mine.
This will hopefully lead to a publication in a reputable mathematics journal.

Finally the code developed by the student will be used by all students of the School of Mathematics who choose to study Game Theory.

The student will be supervised closely by myself with at least weekly meetings.

The student will be given a computer space in one of the labs with all required software.

The outputs of this project will not only prove valuable to the international Game Theoretical community and my own research ambitions but will also provide a valuable set of skills to the appointed student:

- The student will learn the basics of software development by contributing to a large scale open source software.
- The student will learn a novel piece of Mathematics (game theory is only taught in the final year).

## Please give an indicative timescale for the student’s work over the length of the project: (max 150 words)

Week 1: Gain familiarity with the Sage development process (potentially contribute a minor ticket) and start reading about Game Theoretic literature;
Week 2: Start development branch on private server and continue to read about Game Theoretic literature
Week 3: Complete coding of class for cooperative games;
Week 4: Complete coding of class to matching games (to include the Gale-Shapley algorithm);
Week 5: Start coding of class for normal form games (initial solve with exhaustive evaluation of supports) and begin understanding of lrs algorithm.
Week 6: Work on re-writing the lrs algorithm in Python.
Week 7: Complete normal form game class and use normal form class on study of game theoretical interaction between Accident and Emergency units and the Emergency Medical Services Vehicle service.
Week 8: Submit code for review to Sage community, write poster and prepare talk.


## Proposed procedure for appointing students, including selection criteria:

The criteria for this project is that the student have a strong ability to program, a good work ethic and an ability to absorb novel concepts quickly.

A student has already been selected for this project.
His name is James Campbell and he has been selected based on his performance on the Computing for Mathematics module that I teach.

James has received full marks in both the class test and individual coursework components of the class so far.
He presented his coursework at an international conference: https://djangoweekend.org/.
This coursework in fact required him to learn a branch of mathematics that is not normally taught till the final year of the undergraduate degree.

Furthermore James approached me asking if their was a possibility for a research internship this summer.
We have had several meetings discussing what would be expected of him and he seems to be very well suited for this position.
