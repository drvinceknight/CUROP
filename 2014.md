# The Cardiff Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
## CUROP 2014
## Application guidelines and template

In 2014, applications for CUROP are being fielded for the first time online via a Bristol Online Survey.
While we realise that this is a significant change to our application process, this change will help us to make the administration of the project as efficient as possible.
This template includes all of the questions in the online application form so that you can prepare your answers prior to completing the online application.

Applications must be submitted via the online form at https://surveys.cf.ac.uk/curop2014/ by 11.50pm on Thursday 27 February 2014.

Further information and guidance is available at: http://learning.cf.ac.uk/curop/

## Project Title:

Building Game Theoretical Software in a Research Environment

## Home School:

School of Mathematics

## Proposed Start Date:

Monday 14th July

## Proposed End Date:

Friday 5th September

## Total student support costs (based on £170/week full time)

£1360

## Has an application been made to another funding body? Please specify, including expected decision date:

No other application has been made.

## Principal Supervisor:

Vincent Knight (Cardiff University, School of Mathematics)

## Secondary Supervisor (if applicable):

NA

## If there are any other relevant supervision details (E.G. third supervisors or alternate contact details) please let us know here:  (Optional)

NA

## Have you been awarded CUROP funding in the past? If so, briefly describe the outcomes and impact of the project:

I have been involved in multiple successful CUROP projects in the past (as main supervisor as well as secondary supervisor).
One student in particular: Jason Young has done extremely well thanks to his CUROP work.
He has a manuscript in preparation to be submitted to a reputable journal, and is completing his MMATH research project for his with me.
More importantly, funding has been secured for him to start his PhD next term.
This is a great success story and would not have been possible without CUROP.
Furthermore this evidences my ability to lead CUROP projects successfully.

## Brief Summary. Please provide a brief summary (max 300 words) of the project:

Game Theory is the study of interactive decision making.
The School of Mathematics has a growing interest in Game Theory, both from a theoretical and an applied point of view.
This project aims to build software that will be used to solve Game Theoretic problems.

In particular this work will contribute to the open source mathematics package: Sage (http://sagemath.org/).
Sage is actively contributed to by mathematicians all over the world and this project will give a chance to join a thriving community to the chosen student.

Furthermore the code developed by the student will be used by all students of the School of Mathematics who choose to study Game Theory.
