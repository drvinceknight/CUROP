# The Cardiff Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
## CUROP 2014
## Application guidelines and template

In 2014, applications for CUROP are being fielded for the first time online via a Bristol Online Survey.
While we realise that this is a significant change to our application process, this change will help us to make the administration of the project as efficient as possible.
This template includes all of the questions in the online application form so that you can prepare your answers prior to completing the online application.

Applications must be submitted via the online form at https://surveys.cf.ac.uk/curop2014/ by 11.50pm on Thursday 27 February 2014.

Further information and guidance is available at: http://learning.cf.ac.uk/curop/

## Project Title:

## Home School:

## Proposed Start Date:                        Proposed End Date:

## Total student support costs (based on £170/week full time)

## Has an application been made to another funding body? Please specify, including expected decision date:

## Principal Supervisor:

## Secondary Supervisor (if applicable):

## If there are any other relevant supervision details (E.G. third supervisors or alternate contact details) please let us know here:  (Optional)

## Have you been awarded CUROP funding in the past? If so, briefly describe the outcomes and impact of the project:

I have been involved in multiple successful CUROP project in the past (as main supervisor as well as secondary supervisor). One student in particular: Jason Young has done extremely well thanks to his CUROP work. He has a manuscript about to be submitted to a reputable journal, and is completing his research project for his MMath with me. More importantly, funding has been secured for him to start his PhD next term. This is a great success story and would not have been possible without CUROP.
